Notes supporting the charts developed for the Grattan truck plan.

All charts developed using the Grattan truck model are included in the `R/charts`
folder in the Grattan truck model project. This is seperated into two categories:
charts included in the technical appendix (`R/charts/all-appendix-charts.R`) and those
included in the main report (`R/report-charts`). 

For charts in the main report, the `R/report-charts` folder contains a series of scripts.
Each script produces one, or occainsonally two, charts for the final report. However, 
many of these scripts rely on data or outputs from the main grattan truck model, which is developed
from the inputs asumptions in `R/model-inputs` and the fleet turnover forecasts and scenarios in `R/model`. 
Most scripts rely on the main outputs of the model, such as the `policy-outcomes.rds` dataset. 

All the scripts from the report are then collated into a single pdf file. This is done
in the `R/charts/all-report-charts-export.R` script. To create this single pdf file, all 
previous charts in the `R/charts/report-charts` folder should be deleted, and the `all-report-charts-export.R`
script should be run. This should regenerate all charts, saved in the `atlas/report-charts` folder, 
as well as the master pdf file with all charts, located at `atlas/report-charts/report-charts-joined.pdf`. This file is
the file imported to overleaf for the report charts. 

Similarly, charts for the technical appendix are saved in the `atlas` file, under the `appendix` subfolder.
