# grattan-truck-model
A Grattan model of the Australian truck fleet

This repo contains a project with the analysis underpinning the Grattan truck plan report. 

A detailed breakdown of the assumptions included in the modelling can be found in the technical appendix, a pdf file. 

The code underpinning the model itself is also included. Input data to the model which relate to vehicle use, fuel consumption, pollution and 
carbon emissions are included in `R/model-inputs`. The fleet model, which simulates vehicle turnover and use, is included in `R/model`. Further 
modelling which relates to costs, such as the CBA undertaken regarding zero-emission heavy vehicle sales targets are included in `R/cost-modelling`. 

Scripts for all charts included in the report and technical appendix are included in `R/charts`.
